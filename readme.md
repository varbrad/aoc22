## How to run

`npm start <day>`

e.g. `npm start 1`, `npm start 2`

### Performance

I'm really not trying to optimise for performance in these solutions. As long as they dont take more than a few minutes to run, then I'm happy. Below is the approx time it takes for each solution to run on my 2022 MacBook Pro M1 Pro.
